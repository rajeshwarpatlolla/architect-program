#### What is a style guide?
- A style guide is a set of standards that outline how code should be written and organized.
- A style guide contains general rules about “how to write” code, e.g. which quotes to use, how many spaces to indent, where to put line breaks, etc. A lot of minor things.


#### Why a style guide is must?
- Each developer writes code differently. That’s fine, until we are working on our code.
- As count of developers increase, things get messy when all are working on common codebase.
- Style guides are created so new developers can get up to speed on a code base quickly, and then write code that other developers can understand quickly and easily!
